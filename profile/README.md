## üñå Overview

CCleaner Technician ProGuard is a high-performance system optimization tool designed for IT professionals, system administrators, and managed service providers. It provides complete control over maintenance, cleanup, and performance tuning for multiple computers.  

With its advanced registry analysis engine and AI-based junk detection, it removes obsolete entries, broken DLL links, and temporary files that slow down system responsiveness. The visual dashboard provides a clear overview of hardware health, resource usage, and background processes.  

ProGuard also introduces remote management features, allowing technicians to deploy system cleaning profiles across networks. This is ideal for enterprise environments that require standardized performance maintenance across many endpoints.

The optimization process also enhances startup speed and improves browser privacy by removing tracking cookies and cached data.  

CCleaner Technician ProGuard is built to be both fast and reliable, maintaining maximum performance while protecting system integrity ‚Äî an essential toolkit for any technical support operation.
